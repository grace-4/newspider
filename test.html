    <p>Following the first successful season this year HSL hopes to see even more schools from across Australia and New Zealand participating in competitive inter-school esports tournaments. Dota 2 HSL will be broadcast every week on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/HighSchoolLeague">Twitch.tv/HighSchoolLeague</a> where parents, teachers and students will be able to cheer on their teams. Registrations for this season are now open for high school students across ANZ, with the opportunity for more than one team per school to compete. The first round of tournaments begins the week of Monday 5th August 2019 and will run for 10 weeks, showcasing both Dota 2 and Clash Royale. The top two teams from the initial seeds will battle it out in a best-of-three grand final event the week of 7th October 2019, with Dota 2's live final broadcast live on SKY Sport.</p>
    <p><i>“The success we have had has evolved around teamwork and communication”</i> added Vincent Lo, former Captain of the MAGS HSL team.<i>“We ensure that each and every one of us talk as much as we can during the match as communication in a team is the key to success”.</i></p>
