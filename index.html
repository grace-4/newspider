    <h2 class="text-left">General Information</h2>
    <div class="info">
    <p>LetsPlay.Live, Australasia’s leading esports tournament platform & broadcaster, are delighted to announce High School League Season 2 for 2019.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h6>What is HSL?</h6>
    <p>The Dota 2 High School League aspires to provide high schoolers with a fun, competitive, and rewarding esports experience, similar to traditional high school sports. We promote esports as a positive experience that opens up sports team building, leadership opportunities and self-improvement to a wider range of students outside traditional seasonal field and court sports. The HSL gives an opportunity for secondary school students to compete in a competitive esports environment working together as a team and representing their school, similar to traditional high school sports.</p>
    <br>
    <h6>What is DOTA 2?</h6>
    <p>Dota 2 (Defense of the Ancients) is a 5v5 multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA). Each team selects their heroes from a roster of over 100 characters and attempts to take down the enemy core structure, the Ancient. The game has a large focus on teamwork to achieve victory by working towards goals together in the match. In the esports world Dota 2 has consistently held the largest prize pools in the world, upwards of $25m USD.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Following the first successful season this year HSL hopes to see even more schools from across Australia and New Zealand participating in competitive inter-school esports tournaments. Dota 2 HSL will be broadcast every week on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/HighSchoolLeague">Twitch.tv/HighSchoolLeague</a> where parents, teachers and students will be able to cheer on their teams. Registrations for this season are now open for high school students across ANZ, with the opportunity for more than one team per school to compete. The first round of tournaments begins the week of Monday 5th August 2019 and will run for 10 weeks, showcasing both Dota 2 and Clash Royale. The top two teams from the initial seeds will battle it out in a best-of-three grand final event the week of 7th October 2019, with Dota 2's live final broadcast live on SKY Sport.</p>
    <p><i>“The success we have had has evolved around teamwork and communication”</i> added Vincent Lo, former Captain of the MAGS HSL team.<i>“We ensure that each and every one of us talk as much as we can during the match as communication in a team is the key to success”.</i></p>
